        "## Conduct an investigation on a URL database to develop a DGA classification system using machine learning techniques\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "For this task, the company **\"UWEtech\"** enlist your help once more. They have identified a number of suspicious URLs on their logging systems, suspecting that these URLs contain various malware, and so require your expertise to investigate these further. Specifically, they seek a machine learning approach to identify the malware families as observed on their network.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will need to develop a machine learning tool using Python and scikit-learn that can identify URLs based on [Domain Generator Algorithms (DGA)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/2016/12/explained-domain-generating-algorithm/), widely used by command and control malware to avoid static IP blocking.\n",
        "\n",
        "You need to demonstrate experimental design of appropriate feature engineering to characterise the data, that will be used to inform your machine learning classifiers. You should show **at least two** schemes of curating appropriate features, based on the raw data as provided, and show this impacts the performance of your classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are also expected to utilise **3 different classifiers** using the scikit-learn library, and show how the model parameters can impact the performance of the classifiers. It is suggested that you use a Logistic Regression, a Random Forest Classifier, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you should investigate the **performance and explainability** of your classifiers. It is recommended that you use the confusion matrix approach along with performance metrics, to assess how your model performs as well as when and why misclassification may occur. In reporting your findings, you should explain and reflect on this to understand which malware families are more separable, and which are more challenging to classify, using this approach. It is expected that a good performing classifier will achieve over 90% accuracy - however you will be assessed on your experimental design in finding a suitable classifier to achieve this.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dataset**: Please see the folder ***\"Portfolio Assignment\"*** under the Assignment tab on Blackboard for further detail related to the access and download of the necessary dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint**: You should conduct research using the [scikit-learn documentation and API reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), making full use of the sample code that has been provided for your to help guide your research. You should also research Shapley Additive Explanations, and utilise the [online documentation](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). You should also think about a suitable means of generating input features for your classifier that capture sequential properties of text data.\n",

        "* **A clear and iterative experimental approach for developing and refining the classifier to improve performance (10 Marks)**\n",
        "  * *For the higher mark band, it would be expected that you would show an initial experimental design, and then refine this through improving the feature engineering stage, subsequently improving the model performance.*\n",
        "* **Suitable feature engineering stages demonstrating at least two different methods and their performance (10 Marks)**\n",
        "  * *For the higher mark band, it would be expected that you would demonstrate two sensible approaches for curating features, with strong justification as to why they would characterise the data fairly.*\n",
        "* **Suitable use of the sci-kit machine learning library (5 Marks)**\n",
        "  * *For the higher mark band, it would be expected that you would show a good comprehension of the library usage.*\n",
        "* **Clear evaluation of ML performance and explainability (5 Marks)**\n",
        "  * *For the higher mark band, it would be expected that you would use confusion matrices to explain which malware classes are more separable, and which share similarity according to a well-trained model.*\n",
        "* **Clarity and presentation (5 Marks)**\n",
        "  * *For the higher mark band, it would be expected that your notebook is clear and concise, with good use of Markdown to annotate your work professionally.*\n",
